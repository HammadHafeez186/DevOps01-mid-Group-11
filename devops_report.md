# DevOps Report — DevOps01 Midterm (Group 11)

This report summarizes the technologies, CI/CD pipeline, secret management, testing process, and key lessons learned for the Article Management System.

---

## 1) Technologies Used

- Runtime & Frameworks
  - Node.js 18, Express (HTTP server, routing, middleware)
  - EJS (views), Morgan (HTTP logs), method-override
- ORM & Database
  - Sequelize (ORM) with PostgreSQL
  - Models in `models/`, config in `config/config.js`
- Containers & Orchestration
  - Dockerfile (Node 18-alpine, non-root user)
  - Docker Compose: `app` + `postgres` services, health checks, volumes, internal network
- Cloud Hosting
  - Railway (Web service + managed PostgreSQL)
  - Nixpacks build, start via `railway.json` → `node server.js`
- Code Quality & Security
  - ESLint (standard config) — `npm run lint`, `npm run lint:fix`
  - npm audit — `npm run security:audit`
- CI/CD
  - GitHub Actions multi-stage workflow (build → lint/audit → test → docker build → deploy)

Key repo files:
- `config/config.js` — environment configs (prod uses only DATABASE_URL with SSL)
- `models/index.js` — Sequelize bootstrap
- `server.js` — DB authenticate + `sequelize.sync()` before listening
- `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile` — local containers
- `railway.json` — cloud start command
- `test/basic.test.js` — smoke tests

---

## 2) Pipeline Design

High-level stages the workflow implements:

```
┌─────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────┐
│  Build  │ →  │ Lint/Audit  │ →  │   Tests    │ →  │ Docker Build │ →  │ Deploy*  │
└─────────┘    └─────────────┘    └────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────┘
   npm ci        eslint, audit        npm test          docker build         prod
                                                         + tag/push        (branch
                                                                             gate)
```

Details:
- Build: Install dependencies with caching.
- Lint/Audit: ESLint checks and npm security audit.
- Tests: Start app (or use service DB), hit `/health` and root redirect (see `test/basic.test.js`).
- Docker Build: Build production image from Dockerfile; optionally run container checks.
- Deploy (conditional): Only from protected branch (e.g., main). Railway uses `railway.json` start command.

Artifacts and secrets are handled securely (see next section).

---

## 3) Secret Management Strategy

- Never commit secrets
  - `.env` is ignored by Git; removed from tracking if accidentally added.
  - No passwords or tokens hardcoded in repo.
- GitHub Actions
  - Use GitHub Secrets for Docker Hub credentials and any API tokens.
- Railway (production)
  - Web service → Variables: set `NODE_ENV=production` and `DATABASE_URL` only.
  - `config/config.js` in production reads ONLY `DATABASE_URL` and enables SSL
    (`ssl: { require: true, rejectUnauthorized: false }`).
- Local development
  - `.env` exists only locally for dev/testing.

Benefits: consistent, secure configuration; zero leakage of creds into code; easy rotation.

---

## 4) Testing Process

- Unit/Smoke Tests
  - `npm test` runs `test/basic.test.js`
  - Starts the app on a test port, checks:
    - `/health` returns 200 JSON
    - `/` redirects to `/articles`
- Container Health
  - Docker Compose includes healthchecks (PostgreSQL readiness, app health script if configured).
- Database Behavior
  - On production (Railway), `server.js` performs `sequelize.authenticate()` and `sequelize.sync()`
    before listening — ensuring tables exist even if migrations don’t run in-container.
- Lint & Audit
  - `npm run lint`, `npm run security:audit` as non-functional quality gates.

How to run locally (PowerShell):
```powershell
# Lint
npm run lint

# Tests
npm test
{
  "username": "fadhil",
  "password": "passwordpalingsusah",
  "database": "db_development"
}
```

---

## 5) Lessons Learned

- Favor DATABASE_URL in production
  - A single canonical DSN avoids localhost mistakes and config drift in PaaS.
- Keep production config simple and strict
  - We removed fallbacks and heuristics; prod uses only `DATABASE_URL` with SSL.
- Don’t rely on sequelize-cli in cloud runtime
  - Instead, `sequelize.sync()` ensures tables exist so app boots reliably on Railway.
- Secrets must never enter the repo
  - `.env` ignored; credentials only via platform secrets (GitHub Secrets, Railway Variables).
- Observability matters
  - Health endpoints and minimal logs are enough for quick diagnosis.
- Docker healthchecks and dependency ordering reduce flaky starts
  - App waits for DB readiness in Compose; Railway uses built-in service orchestration.

**After** (Environment-based):
```json
{
  "username": "devops_user",
  "password": "secure_password_123",
  "database": "devops_db"
}
```

#### 2. GitHub Secrets Configuration
Required secrets for CI/CD pipeline:

| Secret Name | Purpose | Usage |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| `DOCKER_USERNAME` | Docker Hub authentication | Container registry push |
| `DOCKER_PASSWORD` | Docker Hub authentication | Container registry push |
| `RENDER_API_KEY` | Deployment authentication | Production deployment |
| `RENDER_SERVICE_ID` | Service identification | Deployment targeting |
| `SNYK_TOKEN` | Security scanning | Advanced vulnerability analysis |

#### 3. Runtime Environment Management
```yaml
environment:
  NODE_ENV: ${NODE_ENV:-development}
  DB_HOST: postgres
  DB_USERNAME: ${DB_USERNAME:-devops_user}
  DB_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD:-secure_password_123}
  DATABASE_URL: postgresql://${DB_USERNAME}:${DB_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/${DB_NAME}
```

### Security Benefits

1. **Credential Isolation**: Secrets never appear in source code
2. **Environment Separation**: Different credentials per environment
3. **Access Control**: GitHub team-based secret access
4. **Audit Trail**: Secret usage tracked in CI/CD logs
5. **Rotation Support**: Easy credential updates without code changes

### Best Practices Implemented

- Default values for non-sensitive configuration
- Environment-specific credential handling
- Secure transmission through encrypted channels
- No secret exposure in logs or artifacts

## Containerization Implementation

### Docker Strategy

#### Multi-Stage Optimization
The Dockerfile implements several optimization techniques:

```dockerfile
# Use official Node.js runtime as base image
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set working directory in container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files for dependency installation
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies (production only)
RUN npm ci --only=production && npm cache clean --force
```

#### Security Hardening
```dockerfile
# Create non-root user for security
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && \
    adduser -S nodeuser -u 1001

# Switch to non-root user
USER nodeuser
```

#### Health Monitoring
```dockerfile
# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD node healthcheck.js
```

### Docker Compose Architecture

#### Service Definition
```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${DB_USERNAME:-devops_user}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD:-secure_password_123}
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    
  app:
    build: .
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql://...
```

#### Network Configuration
```yaml
networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge
```

#### Volume Management
```yaml
volumes:
  postgres_data:
    driver: local
```
